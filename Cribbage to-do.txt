More speech synthesis and sound effects; make them play after numbers update
A peg board would be nice
CPU, possibly swap hard and medium discards
CPU, when evaluating hand, consider cards split apart as one point?
CPU, possibly consider the discard of 5-5 as detrimental to own hand score; perhaps deduct PairValues() from HandScoring(), but scale the values to be more appropriate
CPU, prioritize 15s over pairs when playing; be more careful with pairs because of the possibility of pair royals (3)
When cards are put in the crib and PlayByPlay, print out which cards were in the crib; if show-all-cards, include CPU
Within about 6 of the end, CPU, forget the hand and go for good pegging cards, especially if not the first to score
Clean up area around printing the score, especially making sure the board is in a presentable state at game end (count play area score first)
